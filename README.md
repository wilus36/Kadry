Simple calculation python script created to make my mom's life easier (she works in HR)

What this does it takes a series of inputs from the user asking for the emplyee's name, salary, some kind of law-guaranteed raises and date of first employment
and creates a .txt file containing the above as well as calculated date for unlimited-time contract and so on. I fully understand the code I wrote but I have no idea what this is for. If you somehow need to know, please ask my mom.

This is according to polish work law as of 2021.
